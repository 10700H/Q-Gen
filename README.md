Please scan this QR to get an idea on this extension's working

This is how Q-gen generates the QRcode of the active tab and you can download the image or copy it to clipboard.

## WARNING !!!

long URLs are kinda broken especially in Google search so as a work around I have made those links shorter by including google search query only so other data might not be passed.

And that will be fixed when I come with something new.
