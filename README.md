![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ff2b1ff-91b1-4224-a7ca-334d4af9925d)

this is how Q-gen generates the QRcode of the active tab and you can download the image or copy it to clipboard.

WARNING !!!

long URLs are kinda broken especially in Google search so as a work around i have shorten those links to google search query only so other data might not be passed
And that will be fixed when I come with something new.
